# Typescript practice

This repo is for practicing typescript syntax and tooling.

## Getting started

Install Typescript globally using `npm i -g typescript`

Install project dependencies using `npm i`

Run `tsc` to start the Typescript CLI's watch mode, which will compile any changes in the index.ts file into the index.js file.
